This is my first blog post. The purpose of this blog is to demonstrate that I've correctly configured the initial version of the blog, using [Zola](https://www.getzola.org), and to make sure that it works when deployed using GitHub actions from the repo that can be found [here](https://github.com/michaelmaitland/myblog).

My plan for this website is to play around with Zola some more, and to blog about things that interest me. I anticipate that I'll talk about vim, linux, compilers, and more! One thing I'd like to add is a way for people to respond to the content I post. If you have any suggestions or comments, you can create an [issue](https://github.com/michaelmaitland/myblog/issues).
